This repository is a CLI (Command Line Interface) to manage your purchased user games from an the awesome indie store [itch.io](https://itch.io). Please note that depending on the size of your library the amount of time for setup may even take up to 20 minutes.

There are only three main scripts in this repository: 
- `_setup.py` for setting up your library.
- `_query.py` for querying your library.
- `_scratch.py` for managing your titles.


## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, your computer MAY need the following:
- Python 3.8 or later
- `requests` library installed
- `beautifulsoup4` library installed
- a user which ran python scripts before

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

## TODO
- Multithreading for faster setup
- Better setup for optimal SQL Queries
- And much more...
